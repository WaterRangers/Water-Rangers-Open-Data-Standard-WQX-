# Water-Rangers-Open-Data-Standard-WQX
Water Rangers open data standard for community-based water monitoring data, following the WQX standard for the Exchange of Water Quality Data.

## Background


In 2022, Water Rangers was the recipient of a Research Data Alliance's Data Champions grant, which funded the effort to align its existing data structue to be in line with the WQX standard for the Exchange of Water Quality Data. 

The WQX standard for the Exchange of Water Quality Data was developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the US Geological Society (USGS). WQX uses the standards of the National Environmental Information Exchange Network. The WQX schema is a standard set of data formats that specify the data elements and data structure required for submission of data to EPA. 

Water Rangers' collaborator, the Gordon Foundation, has also adopted this water quality standard in DataStreamâ€™s WQX Open Data Schema (DS-WQX). As Water Rangers and DataStream collaborate on a data sharing automation it is imperative our data structures are aligned. 

Water Rangers (waterrangers.ca) is an online open-access platform for sharing water quality data in Canada.  To date, over 200,000 water quality observations have been published on Water Rangers' open data platform by community-based water monitoring groups, universities, Indigenous communities and Indigenous led organizations, researchers and governments. We host data from 20 countries. 

By ensuring community-based water monitoring (CBWM) data is collected, managed, and shared in accordance with this international standard we will better adhere to best practices, and further the reach and use of CBWM data.
